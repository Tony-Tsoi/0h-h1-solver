## 0h h1 solver
## About
This is a solver for the puzzle game 0h h1, a logic game made by Q42.
I wondered how can a computer apply the same rules and logics to solving a simple game.
Turns out it beat me by just a fraction of a second. 
Not that it's faster than me by just a fraction of a second, but the run time of the solver is less than a fraction of a second.

###### Disclaimer: I do not own, or have any correlation to the creation of the game.

## How to use?
Create the puzzle in a 2D int array format, with 0 for blank spots, 1 for red spots, and 2 for blue spots. 
TestClass provides some test cases to demonstrate how would it work.

I might use another language (maybe Python/JavaScript) to create a user-experience-optimized sovler.

## Patch Notes - v1.1
- Updated README
- Reduced runtime in Verifier
- Included more test cases in TestClass

## Update log - Version 1.0
- Included the Reader class for easier solving.

- Next step: 
  + Optimization
  + Making it into a runnable program
